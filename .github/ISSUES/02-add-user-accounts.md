Title: Add user accounts and membership pages

Problem
- No user accounts or profile management; membership flows are not implemented.

Proposal
- Implement sign-up/login endpoints, per-user profile endpoints (view/edit/delete), and add simple UI or API docs for membership flows. Use secure password storage and session or token-based auth.

Acceptance criteria
- Endpoints to create users, login (session or token), view/edit profile, and delete account.
- Frontend: simple membership page or API examples for clients.
- Basic input validation and tests or manual verification steps.
